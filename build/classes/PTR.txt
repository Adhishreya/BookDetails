if in to many relation, in the target part if a record is deleted then all the related entities in the source will also be deleted
 
 
 In bookDetails database here, if a book is deleted, then all the categories associated with the book will also get deleted,
  so even if any other bok is associated with the same category they will also be deleted;
  
  when used with cascade delete then, all the data will get deleted
  
  publisher must also be varied .. as a one to many relation with the books
  
  
  preferable to use sets instead of list in relations
